🚀 A structured journey to mastering C, C++, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) — from fundamentals to advanced problem-solving.

This repository documents my learning process, code implementations, problem-solving approaches, and resources. It’s intended both as a personal roadmap and a guide for others starting their journey.





This repo contains:

-Step-by-step implementations of C and C++ fundamentals.
-Well-documented solutions for common and advanced DSA problems.
-A curated roadmap for interview preparation (FAANG-level DSA).
-Notes, explanations, and practice codes to solidify concepts.
-Whether you’re a beginner starting from scratch or someone preparing for coding interviews, this repository can be your companion.

🎯 Learning Goals
-Master C programming basics (memory management, pointers, arrays, strings).
-Transition smoothly into C++ (OOP, STL, templates, advanced concepts).
-Develop strong problem-solving skills using DSA.
-Prepare for technical interviews with hands-on practice.
-Build the habit of writing clean, modular, and optimized code.
